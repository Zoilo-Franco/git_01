In panes of quiet gray it waits,    
A studio built of code and light,   
Where data wakes and recreates    
Its hidden patterns out of night.   

A console whispers > in blue,   
Inviting thoughts to take their form,   
While scripts align in careful view   
Against the crash of error’s storm.   

Objects bloom in tidy rows,   
In Environment’s ordered frame,   
Each tibble neatly stacked and posed,   
Each column bearing truth’s small flame.    

Plots arise like sudden art,    
From ggplot’s layered grammar spun—   
A scatter, bar, or pie-chart heart,   
Where variables and vision run.   

Markdown threads the text with thought,   
Weaving code and voice as one,    
So stories from the data wrought    
Shine bright as if by sun.    

Packages drift from CRAN’s wide sea,    
Libraries of crafted skill,   
Installed with quiet ceremony,    
Called forth at will.   

And when the bugs begin to creep,   
Traceback follows where they hide;    
Step by step, through loops so deep,    
Logic stands reclaimed with pride.  

O RStudio, steady guide,  
Through vectors, frames, and modeling’s art—
